# Austin Zoning Map

*Purpose*: I wanted to better understand the zoning rules in Austin. The Austin city website does have an [interactive zoning map](http://www.austintexas.gov/GIS/ZoningProfile/), but it only allows you to look at the zoning details of one building at a time. (You have to click on a place on the map to see its zoning details.) I wanted to be able to see the zoning codes for all locations at once, so I built this tool using the same API as the Austin website.

# Installation
This project is written in Haskell and Typescript.

To build, you must have `stack`, `webpack`, and `yarn` on your computer.

Anyway, assuming you have the dependencies, you must do

```bash
cd client
yarn
webpack
cd ..
cd server
stack build
stack exec austin-zoning
```

The last command above starts the Haskell server on `localhost:3000` that serves both the static content (`/index.html` and `/bundle.js`) and the dynamic content (at `/area`).

# Development
To continuously rebuild the project, run `webpack –watch` in the `client/` directory and `stack build --file-watch --fast` in the `server/` directory. Every time you make a change to the server code, make sure to restart the server executable (`stack exec austin-zoning`). (I'd like to find a way to restart the server executable every time it changes, but I'm not sure how to do that.)
